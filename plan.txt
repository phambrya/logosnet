Group 7: Bryan PhamProject 2: LogosNetDue: 07/31/2022LogosNet PlanSummary:	This assignment I will be implementing a server and two distinct types of clients for a simple online chat application. The two types of clients are observers and participant. The main job of observers is that they are able to receive and display a stream of messages from the server in real-time, but they do not send any messages. The main job of participant is that they are able to send messages to other participant along with private messages. You server should be able handle up to 255 observers and 255 participants. Observers and participants are allowed to leave any time and participant will have to make a unique username when connected.Challenges:	For this assignment I believe that the most challenging aspect would be handling an online chat application that be able to only 255 of observers and participants each, along with that fact that sending the right messages to observer and participant. Also, another thing is that dealing with private messages between participants. I am not sure forking would be the same as project 1 and project 2 to handle participants and observers simultaneously.Resources:1.
